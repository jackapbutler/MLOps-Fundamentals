# MLOps Fundamentals
## DVC and WandB MLOps Workflow
- Used Sklearn's MLPClassifier to perform classification on a diabetes dataset.

### When a push is made to a new branch the following occurs:
- Automate the unit testing on a dummy dataset with a certain number of features.
- Automate a pipeline for getting data, processing data, training a model and storing metrics.
- Automated the generation of reports and accuracy statistics using CML and GitHub Actions.
- Automated performing experiments with different parameters and visualising results.
